# Tailwag Utils

This crate is a collection of various utility functions and structs. While it is
a part of the `tailwag` library suite, these utilities function independely of
that library.

Many of these could be their own crates, however I've chosen to consolidate them
all (for now) into a grab-bag of useful tools.

## Details

This crate is part of the [`tailwag`](https://www.github.com/nikwithak/tailwag)
suite of libraries.

Better documentation and details to be added at a later time (#TODO @nikwithak).
